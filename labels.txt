###Address mapping

The upper portion of the virtual address is used as an offset into the page table (which is implemented as an array or list). 

The value at the offset is a *page table entry* that contains information about how that particular virtual page is mapped. 



###Page Table Entry

The structure of the page table entry (PTE) is architecture specific, but generally it contains the following information:

* The status of the mapping, which could be:
 * Valid (currently in phsyical memory)
 * Invalid (on disk somewhere)
* Where to find the physical page
* Read, write, and execute permissions for the process
* If the page has been modified
