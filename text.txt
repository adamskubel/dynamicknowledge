What's a memory address actually mean? As programmers, we usually don't think about the actual value of a pointer. We only deal with it on relative terms. 
Does it represent the actual location in RAM that the program writes to?
<br/>
Consider the following code:
<pre>
void main()
{
	cout << *(0);
}
</pre>
This is obviously going to crash. The memory at address '0' should be empty.
<br/>
But it's not that the RAM cells for address '0' are unpopulated. Something else is stopping the program from reading that address.

Linux actually doesn't let processes access memory directly. Instead, it gives them <b>virtual memory</b>.
<br/><br/>

{LINK=PageTable}VirtualSpaceLink{/LINK}

The size of the virtual memory space is dependent on the system architecture; x86 would have a 2^32 possible virtual addresses,
and a 64-bit system would have 2^64 virtual addresses. However, only a subset of this space is available for use by the application.
<br/>
For sake of simplicity, we'll work with a 32-bit memory space.


Virtual memory is mapped to physical memory by the operating system. This mapping is done in blocks called pages.
A page of virtual memory maps to a page of physical memory.

This virtual -> physical mapping is defined in the <b>page table</b>.
